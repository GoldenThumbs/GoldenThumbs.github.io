               Howdy! My name is Serenity,<br>
               sometimes "Renny" for short or "GoldenThumbs" online,<br>
               and this is my humble website!
               <br><br>
               Here you will see my various technical ramblings and occasional artistic tinkering;<br>
               immortalized in only the best HTML a bored and half-literate amoeba could muster!<br>
               (with plenty of help from resources on the Internet)
               <br><br>
               If topics like:
               <ul>
                  <li>Graphics Programming</li>
                  <li>Game Engine Development</li>
                  <li>C Programming</li>
                  <li>Turtles</li>
                  <li>Bad Puns</li>
               </ul>
               interest you, then there are probably better places for that...<br>
               If you're interested in specifically what I, Serenity Skiff, have to say on any given topic; THAT'S GREAT, I'M ME!
