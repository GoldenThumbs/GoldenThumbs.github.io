               Howdy! My name is Serenity, and you have found my humble blog.
               <br><br>
               Here you will see my various technical ramblings and occasional artistic tinkering immortalized
               in only the best HTML a bored half-literate
               amoeba could muster (with plenty of online resources).
               <br><br>
               If topics like:<br>
               <ul>
                  <li>Graphics Programming</li>
                  <li>Game Engine Development</li>
                  <li>C Programming</li>
                  <li>Turtles</li>
                  <li>Bad Puns</li>
               </ul>
               interest you, then please look elsewhere...<br>
               Frankly you can find much better resources online and in the library than you can from me.
               <br><br>
               If you're interested in specifically what I, Serenity Skiff, have to say on any given topic; THAT'S GREAT, I'M ME!
